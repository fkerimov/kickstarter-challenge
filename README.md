# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
The project examines the results of Kickstarter campaigns in the 'Theater' category of the provided Kickstarter Dataset. 
### Purpose
The project aims to examine the results of funding campaigns for subcategory of 'plays' based on their launch date and funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The line chart below demonstrates the outcomes of theater campaigns based on their Launch Date. The comparison of 'successful', 'failed', and 'cancelled' outcomes in the category are demonstrated against the X axis, which groups the campaigns from 2009-2017 based on month, and the Y axis that provides the number of campaigns. The graph demonstrates that May, June, and July lauches were most successful with 111, 100, and 87 sucessful campaigns launched in each month respectively. Given that May, June, and July saw the launch of most Theater campaigns in total (166, 153, 138 campaigns we launched respectively), the number of failed campaigns are also higher than in other months: 52, 49, and 50 failed campaigns respectively. Effectively, 67% of campaings launched in May were successful, 65% in June, and 63% were successful in July. It is worth nothing that most of the months have relatively similar success rates except for December, where only 49% of the launched campaigns were successful, marking the lowest success rate in the Theater category of the Kickstarter Dataset.
